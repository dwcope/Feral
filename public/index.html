	<h1>A Feral Coder</h1>
	
    <p>Having been born at too young an age, I was abandoned by my
    mum in the Australian Outback. A short time later, I was
    snatched by dingoes and hauled to their austere digs. They took
    great care to make me feel at home and I was soon looked upon
    as just another of the pack. Those were the good years -- we
    roamed free, masters of all we could see, washing down great
    gobbets of 'roo with flagons of Foster's.</p>
